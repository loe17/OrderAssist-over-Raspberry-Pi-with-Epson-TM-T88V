"""Configuration handling.

The configuration is a single YAML file (``/etc/bonbridge/config.yaml``).
It is read at start-up and can be rewritten by the web interface.  Every
value has a defined default so that a missing or partial file still yields a
working daemon.

PyYAML is used when available (``apt install python3-yaml``); if it is not,
BonBridge falls back to a JSON file with the same schema so the daemon never
becomes unusable because of a missing dependency.
