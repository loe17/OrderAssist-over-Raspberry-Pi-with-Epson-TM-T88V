# Several print groups (kitchen, bar, counter)

## The problem

OrderAssist assigns each printer to a **print group**. A printer is identified
there solely by its **IP address** - the port is fixed at 9100 and cannot be
changed.

It follows that **two printers need two IP addresses.** They cannot be told
apart by using two ports on the same IP.

BonBridge therefore offers two routes.

## Route A: one BonBridge device per printer (simple)

Each printer gets its own Pi Zero 2 W. Nothing else to do - every device has
its own IP by nature.

| Pros | Cons |
|---|---|
| Simplest setup | ~50 EUR per printer |
| A failure affects one printer only | More devices, more power supplies |
| Short USB runs to the printer | Several web interfaces |

This is the recommended variant for two or three printers in different places
(the kitchen and the bar are rarely next to each other).

## Route B: one device, several IP addresses (elegant)

A Raspberry Pi 4 (or an x86 machine) serves several USB printers. Each printer
gets an **additional IP address** on the same network interface, and BonBridge
binds its listener to that address only.

```
                      ┌── USB ──▶ kitchen printer  ← 192.168.1.51:9100
Pi 4 ── LAN ──────────┤
 (192.168.1.50)       └── USB ──▶ bar printer      ← 192.168.1.52:9100

  Web interface: http://192.168.1.50:8080/
```

### 0. Connect the printers physically

Before anything is configured, both printers have to be attached at the same
time and be detected.

**Power - the single most important point.** Every receipt printer needs its
**own 24 V power supply**. The Raspberry Pi powers none of them. The Pi itself
needs a strong supply once several USB devices are attached:

| Device | Power supply for the Pi |
|---|---|
| Pi Zero 2 W | 5 V / 2.5 A |
| Pi 3 | 5 V / 2.5 A |
| Pi 4 / Pi 5 | the original PSU (5 V / 3 A resp. 5 V / 5 A) |

If the overview shows **under-voltage** under "Why?", the supply or the cable
is too weak - which otherwise shows up as printers disappearing at random.

**Wiring options:**

```
Option 1 - direct (up to 2 printers on a Pi 4/5)

   Pi 4  ┌── USB-A ──── USB-B ──▶ kitchen printer  (own 24 V supply)
         └── USB-A ──── USB-B ──▶ bar printer      (own 24 V supply)

Option 2 - with a powered USB hub (from 3 printers, or on a Pi Zero)

   Pi ── USB ──▶ [ powered USB hub with its own PSU ]
                        ├── USB-B ──▶ printer 1
                        ├── USB-B ──▶ printer 2
                        └── USB-B ──▶ printer 3
```

* On the **Pi 4** prefer the black USB 2.0 ports if a printer misbehaves.
* The **Pi Zero 2 W** has only one USB port - several printers require a
  **powered** hub, otherwise the voltage collapses.
* **Passive hubs** are the most common cause of trouble with several printers.

**Verify that both are detected:**

```bash
bonbridge scan
```

Both printers must appear with their own entry. Two identical units differ
only in their **serial number** - you will need it in a moment:

```
usb     EPSON TM-T88V (04b8:0202)
        vendor_id_hex: 04b8
        product_id_hex: 0202
        serial: X3M4820015          <- this line
usb     EPSON TM-T88V (04b8:0202)
        serial: X3M4820099
```

> If `bonbridge scan` shows only one printer, it is a hardware problem (power,
> cable, hub), not a software problem. Do not continue until both are visible.

## The short way: BonBridge finds the addresses itself

From 1.3.4 the extra addresses no longer have to be chosen and created by
hand. **Web interface → System → "IP addresses for several printers"**:

1. Switch on **"Assign free IP addresses automatically"** and save.
2. Press **"Assign now"**.

BonBridge then looks for free addresses in its own subnet, creates an IP alias
for every active printer without a fixed address and enters it at the printer.
The addresses appear in the table below and on the status slip.

The same works over SSH:

```bash
sudo bonbridge aliases              # only scan and show
sudo bonbridge aliases --assign     # scan and assign
sudo systemctl restart bonbridge
```

### How "free" is decided

Not by ping - **by ARP, per RFC 5227.** The difference matters: a Windows PC
does not answer ping by default but of course keeps using its IP address. A
ping-based check would report exactly that address as "free" and take down
both devices. No IPv4 host can refuse ARP and still work on the network.

The probe is an ARP request with **sender address 0.0.0.0** - so it does not
claim the address it is asking about. Three requests per address, so a single
lost broadcast cannot make a used address look free. If something answers,
BonBridge records the answering MAC address; that is what later distinguishes
"somebody else took it" from "this is our own alias".

By default the search runs **downwards from the top of the subnet**, because
DHCP pools least often reach there. A fixed range can be entered:
`192.168.1.240-192.168.1.250`.

### What this cannot do

An address being free today says nothing about tomorrow. If it lies inside the
router's DHCP pool, the router may lease it to a phone later - and then
receipts vanish without anything looking broken.

**So: exclude the range used here from the router's DHCP pool.** That remains
the only real protection.

BonBridge re-probes the assigned addresses every five minutes. If a foreign MAC
suddenly answers, it shows up under *Diagnostics → All checks* as an error
naming the intruder. BonBridge cannot prevent the case - only notice it and say
so.

### Reboot, conflicts, releasing

* The aliases survive a reboot: BonBridge records in `state.json` what it
  created and re-creates it at start-up - **after probing again**. If the
  address has been taken over in the meantime it is *not* re-claimed but given
  up; the printer falls back to `0.0.0.0` and keeps printing while the conflict
  is reported.
* Addresses entered by hand are never touched. Only addresses BonBridge created
  itself can be released.
* **With a single printer nothing happens, on purpose:** `0.0.0.0` already
  answers on every address of the device. To assign one anyway, confirm the
  prompt or use `--force`.

---

## The manual way

Still valid - and the right choice when the addresses are fixed for other
reasons.

### 1. Choose free IP addresses

The additional addresses must

* be in the same subnet as the device,
* be **outside the router's DHCP range** (otherwise the router will hand them
  to another device eventually),
* not be in use yet.

Check:

```bash
ping -c1 192.168.1.51    # must NOT answer
```

### 2. Create the IP aliases

The installer ships a systemd unit for this. The instance name is
`<interface>-<address>-<prefix>`:

```bash
# find the network interface
ip -o addr show scope global

sudo systemctl enable --now 'bonbridge-ip@eth0-192.168.1.51-24.service'
sudo systemctl enable --now 'bonbridge-ip@eth0-192.168.1.52-24.service'
```

On a Pi Zero 2 W the interface is usually `wlan0`:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable --now 'bonbridge-ip@wlan0-192.168.1.51-24.service'
```

Verify:

```bash
ip -4 -o addr show scope global
```

The aliases survive a reboot because the units are enabled.

### 3. Create the printers in BonBridge

Web interface → **Printers**:

1. **Scan for devices** - both USB printers must appear.
2. First printer: name `Kitchen`, *IP address for port 9100* set to
   `192.168.1.51`, assign the device, save.
3. **Add printer** → name `Bar`, `bind` set to `192.168.1.52`, assign the
   second device, save.

Or directly in `/etc/bonbridge/config.yaml`:

```yaml
printers:
  - id: kitchen
    name: Kitchen
    enabled: true
    bind: 192.168.1.51
    transport:
      type: usb
      vendor_id: 0x04b8
      product_id: 0x0202
      serial: "X3M4820015"      # tells two identical printers apart
    profile: TM-T88V

  - id: bar
    name: Bar
    enabled: true
    bind: 192.168.1.52
    transport:
      type: usb
      vendor_id: 0x04b8
      product_id: 0x0202
      serial: "X3M4820099"
    profile: TM-T88V
```

> **Important with identical printers:** two identical TM-T88V units share the
> same vendor/product ID. To keep the assignment stable the **serial number**
> must be configured. `bonbridge scan` shows it. Without a serial the
> assignment can swap after a reboot.

### 4. Enter them in OrderAssist

| Print group | IP in the POS app |
|---|---|
| Kitchen | `192.168.1.51` |
| Bar | `192.168.1.52` |

Then assign them under **Drucker → Ausdruckgruppen definieren**. Distributing
the orders is done by OrderAssist itself - BonBridge only provides the
printers.

| Pros | Cons |
|---|---|
| One device, one web interface, one update | All printers must be cabled to one place |
| Cheaper from two printers on | If the device fails, all printers stop |
| Shared diagnostics and support report | Requires IP management in the router |

## Mixed operation

One BonBridge device can serve USB printers **and** monitor a network printer
at the same time:

```yaml
  - id: counter
    name: Counter
    bind: 192.168.1.53
    transport:
      type: network
      host: 192.168.1.30    # printer with its own UB-E04
      port: 9100
```

Useful when you want status monitoring, spooling and one shared support report
for the network printers as well. If you do not need that, enter the network
printer directly in the POS application.

## Limits

* **One printer, several groups:** no problem - OrderAssist handles that by
  assigning the same printer to several groups.
* **More than ~4 USB printers on one Pi:** possible, but watch the power
  budget and use a powered USB hub.
* **Different subnets:** IP aliases only work within the same network as the
  POS devices.
